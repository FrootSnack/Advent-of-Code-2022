## Part 1
Quite straightforward, just a simple algorithm to find a global maximum.

## Part 2
A little more complicated. Since we've been asked to find the top N values, I implemented a priority queue in Python and allowed N to vary. As mentioned in the source code, I made use of code snippets from [this GeeksforGeeks article.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-in-python/)
