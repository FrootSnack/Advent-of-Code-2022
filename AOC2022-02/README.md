## Part 1
Instead of complicating this code with messy if-else statements, I instead elected to use dictionaries to store both the numerical value of each player choice and the opponent pick that would result in a player win for a given player pick.

## Part 2
Similar to part 1, I felt that dictionaries as a quick lookup table were the way to go. Since I could treat each of these dictionaries as simple functions, my code was greatly simplified and I was left with a speedy solution to the problem.
