## Part 1
File trees: not my favorite. The good thing is that this command input can be parsed relatively easily, so the actual challenge here is in our storage and lookup method. Since we only care about the overall size of a given directory and not, say, the number of files that it contains, my first thought is to create a tree whose nodes are directories with a `name` parameter.

That's not a bad idea, though the details of implementation are a bit hazy. So, let's get a bit more precise. Here's what we know about the features that our solution must include.

1. **Quickly access parent directory.** The `cd ..` command tells me that, whatever our implementation, we should avoid the need to traverse the entire tree to access our parent directory. This might be as simple as having nodes encapsulate a parent reference.
2. **More than two children.** As shown in `input.txt`, a given directory may contain more than two child directories. This immediately rules out a binary tree and tells me that I might want to shoot for a solution using arrays of children.
3. **No need for deletion.** We never need to remove items from our directory tree, just insert them and read their values. This allows us to ignore slow deletion times for otherwise efficient solutions.

All of this talk about trees and pointers has me itching to use C (a statement that I never expected to make in my life). My solution begins, as many good things do, with a `typedef struct` statement encapsulating our parameters.

```c
typedef struct {
    Dir* parent;    // pointer to parent dir
    int ccount;     // number of children
    Dir** children; // pointers to child dirs
    char* name;     // string to hold dir name
    int size;       // size of dir and child dirs
} Dir;
```

Next, I'll go ahead and define `process_ls()`, a method that will dynamically `malloc` the provided node's `children`.

```c
void process_ls(Dir* dir, char* dirs[]) {
    if (dir->children == NULL) {
        dir->children = malloc(dir->ccount * sizeof(Dir*));
        for (int i = 0; i < dir->ccount; i++) {
            dir->children[i] = malloc(sizeof(Dir));
            strcpy(dir->children[i]->name, dirs[i]);
        }
    }   
}
```

Then I'll define `clean_tree()` to `free` the memory that we allocated in `process_ls()`.

```c
void clean_tree(Dir* root) {
    // recurse down, then free each child
    for (int i = 0; i < root->ccount; i++) {
        clean_tree(root->children[i]);
        free(root->children[i]);
        root->children[i] = NULL;
    }
    // free the list of children
    free(root->children);
    root->children = NULL;
}
```

That's all of the helper code we'll need for our solution! Our `main()` method is quite simple: we'll go through the input file, splitting on `\n` (newline) characters, and parse our commands accordingly. With this last piece of the puzzle completed, I had my solution!

> I recognize that this is definitely a bit of an overengineered solution for the given problem. For today's challenge, I wanted to focus more on building my C competency and creating a robust and efficient solution than on slapping a Python script together as quickly as possible.
