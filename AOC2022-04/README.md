## Part 1
I'll admit it: my variable naming convention for this script could use a little work. I'm pretty sure that my method to check whether one range entirely contains the other is about as efficient as I can get it, which I'm quite happy about.

## Part 2
Ah, yes: the joy of being able to modify minimal portions of code in order to adapt it to a similar task. Due to the way that I implemented my overlap checks in part 1, this second part was a breeze.
